  For all countries the general trend is that life expectancy increases over time at a gradual trate. With the exception 
being Zimbabwe, which was adecreasing in 2000 and is now increasing at the fastest  rate.
  Gdp is either increasing at a steady consistent rate for the United States and China, and is almost unchanging for the 
other countries.
  The distribution of life expectancy by country highlights that with a lower life expectancy, the range of life expectancy is muoch greater. I think this would be 
due to the factors causing life expectancy to be so low. For example certain illness may affect people of all ages, causing
young people to pass away sooner leading to the lower values of the distribution. However, not everyone may fall victim to 
the illness allowing for some people to live much longer than others. 
  The other thing to note is that for most countries the distrubution of life expectancy is small, regardless of the 
distribution of GDP.
  
  The summary statistics reveal significant disparities in both GDP and life expectancy across countries. Wealthier nations 
such as the United States, Germany, and China exhibit higher life expectancy, with Germany having the highest average 
(79.66 years). In contrast, Zimbabwe has the lowest life expectancy (50.09 years on average) and the highest variability, 
likely reflecting economic and healthcare challenges.
  GDP varies drastically, with the United States leading at an average of $14 trillion, while Zimbabwe has the lowest at
approximately $9 billion. The correlation analysis (0.34) suggests a positive relationship between GDP and life expectancy, 
indicating that economic prosperity may contribute to improved healthcare and living conditions. However, the moderate 
strength of this correlation implies other factors, such as government policies and social development, also play a role.
